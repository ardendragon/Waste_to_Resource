# Waste_to_Resource
Every day, millions of perfectly usable objects are discarded as waste, despite being in good condition. This unnecessary waste leads to overconsumption, environmental pollution, and resource depletion. To combat this problem, we created an app named “Waste-to-Resource” with the idea of reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Our app serves as a solution that matches used items and people’s needs. By using this app, we can reduce waste and create a more sustainable future.
